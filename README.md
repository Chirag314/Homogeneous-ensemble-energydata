Ensemble Neural Network Predictions on Energy Data
This readme file describes a Python script implementing an ensemble of neural networks for predicting electricity consumption in the Energy dataset.

Project Overview:

    This project utilizes 20 individually trained neural networks as an ensemble model to forecast electricity consumption.
    Each network is trained on a randomly sampled subset of the data, promoting diversity and potentially mitigating overfitting.
    The final prediction represents the average of all individual network predictions, aiming to improve overall accuracy.
    Code Breakdown:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

    Reads the Energy dataset from a Github URL using pandas.
    Checks for missing values and confirms their absence.
    Splits the data into training and testing sets with a 70:30 ratio.
    Separates the test set into features and target variables.
    Ensemble Model Creation:

Defines a loop iterating 20 times (the ensemble size).
Within each iteration:
Randomly samples a fraction (70%) of the training data.
Extracts features and target variables from the sampled data.
Builds a 4-layer neural network with ReLU activation.
Compiles the model with Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
Trains the model on the sampled data for 25 epochs.
Predicts electricity consumption for the test set and calculates the individual MSE.
Adds the individual predictions to a cumulative total.
Final Prediction and Evaluation:

Calculates the final predicted electricity consumption by averaging the cumulative total from all models.
This final prediction can be compared to actual values or further analyzed for accuracy and insights.
Key Takeaways:

    This approach leverages the strengths of multiple neural networks trained on different data subsets.
    Ensemble models often outperform individual models, providing more robust and reliable predictions.
    The code demonstrates practical implementation of ensemble learning with Keras in Python.
Further Work:

    Experiment with different ensemble sizes and neural network architectures.
    Implement other ensemble techniques like bagging or boosting.
    Evaluate the final predictions against actual consumption data for accuracy measures.
    Visualize the ensemble performance and analyze individual model contributions.
Dependencies:

    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    tensorflow
    keras
